# Gatsby Meetup

<Note>

- I know this is a Gatsby meetup

</Note>

---

# NextJS

<Note>

- But I want to talk about NextJS

</Note>

# 😱

<Note>

- Not entirely about NextJS
- More about MDX, really
- The ASI style guide was made with MDX, this was just as MDX was
  released with Gatsby

### "If your only tool is a hammer, everything is a nail"

- A thought symposium piece by Scott Spence

<Note>

- Onto the title of this talk
- Title kindly offered up by Paul Scanlon

</Note>

# Fair Warning

---

# Opinions Ahead

# 🤔

<Note>

- These are my opinions on using MDX

</Note>

---

# Let's talk about MDX

<Note>

- Just a little more time to talk about MDX
- and how awesome it is
- This presentation is made with MDX
- I recall the first time I discovered MDX for a presentation
  - Sara Viera at Vue Conf London 2018
- Being a blogger/digital gardener/thought pamphlet author this really
  useful
- Why is it useful?
- MDX allows for the addition of JSX to Markdown, so React components
  in your documentation.
- MDX is a great tool for making interactive documentation no doubt
  you have seen sites like Josh Comeau's site which is jam packed with
  whimsy features powered by MDX
